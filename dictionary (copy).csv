function,"A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.

parameter,"In computer programming, a parameter or ""argument"" is a value that is passed into a function.
",https://techterms.com/definition/parameter
variable,"In mathematics, a variable is a symbol or letter, such as ""x"" or ""y"", that represents a value. Variables are also used in computer programming to store specific values within a program. They are assigned both a data type as well as a value. For example, a variable of the string data type may contain a value of ""sample text"" while a variable of the integer data type may contain a value of ""11"".

dictionary,"Each key is separated from its value by a colon (:), the items are separated by commas, and the whole thing is enclosed in curly braces. An empty dictionary without any items is written with just two curly braces, like this: {}. Keys are unique within a dictionary while values may not be. The values of a dictionary can be of any type, but the keys must be of an immutable data type such as strings, numbers, or tuples.
",https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_dictionary.htm
tuple,"Tuples are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of heterogeneous data. Tuples are also used for cases where an immutable sequence of homogeneous data is needed (such as allowing storage in a set or dict instance).

ascii table," ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers, so an ASCII code is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort. ASCII was developed a long time ago and now the non-printing characters are rarely used for their original purpose.

module,"A module allows you to logically organize your Python code. Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use. A module is a Python object with arbitrarily named attributes that you can bind and reference. Simply, a module is a file consisting of Python code. A module can define functions, classes and variables. A module can also include runnable code.
",https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_modules.htm
string,"Strings in Python are identified as a contiguous set of characters represented in the quotation marks. Python allows for either pairs of single or double quotes. Subsets of strings can be taken using the slice operator ([ ] and [:] ) with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the string and working their way from -1 at the end.

multithreading,"Running several threads is similar to running several different programs concurrently, but with the following benefits. Multiple threads within a process share the same data space with the main thread and can therefore share information or communicate with each other more easily than if they were separate processes. Threads sometimes called light-weight processes and they do not require much memory overhead; they are cheaper than processes. A thread has a beginning, an execution sequence, and a conclusion. It has an instruction pointer that keeps track of where within its context it is currently running. It can be pre-empted (interrupted). It can temporarily be put on hold (also known as sleeping) while other threads are running - this is called yielding.

object,"A unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods. 
",https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_classes_objects.htm
method,"A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.
",https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_classes_objects.htm
class," user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation. 
",https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_classes_objects.htm
list,"The most basic data structure in Python is the sequence. Each element of a sequence is assigned a number - its position or index. The first index is zero, the second index is one, and so forth. The list is a most versatile datatype available in Python which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Important thing about a list is that items in a list need not be of the same type.
",https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_lists.htm
loop,"In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times. Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths. A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times.
